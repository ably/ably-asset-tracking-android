/**
 * An set of interfaces that represent the parts of the Ably client library which are used by the Ably Asset Tracking SDKs.
 *
 * These exist so that we can mock out the Ably client library when testing the [DefaultAbly] class. The interfaces here are more or less a direct copy of the corresponding `ably-java` classes, and are expected to exhibit the same behaviour. They do remove some details that would be overkill here, such as class hierarchies and interface conformances, instead opting to add these inherited properties and methods directly on the interfaces.
 *
 * The aim here is _not_ to remove the usage of all `ably-java` types; we continue using types from that codebase if they are just interfaces or are easy to construct. We just intend to use interfaces to replace `ably-java` classes that would be hard to mock.
 *
 * `ably-java` doesnâ€™t currently have nullability annotations (see [issue #639](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/issues/639) there), so when writing these interfaces we need to make our own judgements about nullability, based on our knowledge of the behaviour of the Ably client libraries.
